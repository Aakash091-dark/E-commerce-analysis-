Welcome to the E-Commerce Sentiment Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from Amazon to extract meaningful insights about user sentiment. Using a dataset of 2,000 reviews, we leverage various libraries and techniques to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the sentiment distribution, ultimately building a robust sentiment analysis pipeline.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Amazon customer reviews and determine whether they express positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, we uncover insights that could be useful for businesses to improve products, services, and customer experiences.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
We utilized the following libraries and tools for this project:

- NLTK: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
- Scikit-learn: Vectorization, model training, and evaluation
- Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- NumPy: Numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- Collections: Frequency analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the Project
- Sentiment Analysis: Accurately classify the sentiment of each review.
- Insights Extraction: Identify trends in customer feedback for business improvement.
- Machine Learning Application: Experiment with various ML models to achieve optimal performance.
